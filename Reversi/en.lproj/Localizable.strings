"❀Summary:
➥The way you play isREVERsi is the way you play Othello, but different way to calculate score. isREVERsi counts total flips of your discs while Othello counts total number of your discs.
❀How to Play:
➥There are two sides, black and white. The number on each disc is the number of flips of itself. You can place a disc on \"✦\", that is, anywhere as long as your discs surround your opponent's discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Any disc you surround will flip over and be yours. You will be skipped if you cannot place a disc. Games end when both two players cannot place a disc.
❀Challenges:
➥In single player mode, there are some challenges you can complete. Challenges appear in the result phase of the levels.
❀Currency:
➥In isREVERsi, we use \"Flips\" as our currency. You can earn it by completing challenges.";
