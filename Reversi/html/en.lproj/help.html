        ❀Summary:<br />
        ➥The way you play isREVERsi is the same as Othello, but the score calculation is different from Othello. isREVERsi counts the total numbers of flips of your discs as a score while Othello counts total number of your discs.<br />
        ❀How to Play:<br />
        ➥There are two sides, black and white. The number on each disc is the number of flips of itself. You can place a disc on "✦", that is, anywhere as long as your discs surround your opponent's discs horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Any disc you surround will flip over and be yours. You will be skipped if you cannot place a disc. A game ends when both two players cannot place a disc.<br />
        ❀Challenges:<br />
        ➥In single player mode, there are some challenges you can complete. Challenges appear in the result phase of the levels. If you complete all of them, you can obtain unlimited undos and no Ads. Notice that challenges differ in different sizes of the game board, your side, your rival, classic or Zyphyrus.<br />
        ❀Currency:<br />
        ➥In isREVERsi, we use "Flips" as our currency. You can earn it by completing challenges or watching Ads. It can be used to undo a game to any of your turns before.<br />
        ❀Two-player Mode:<br />
        ➥Tap or swipe on the logo on the title screen until it gets half-white and half-black to enter this mode. Then you can play with your friends or yourself offline.<br />
        ❀Party:<br />
        ➥Players are allowed to use the special ability like in Zephyrus. The special ability is only available after 4th turn. Tap on your score in your turn to choose your special ability and use it. Drag your discs to move. After you use the speical ability, your score will be transparent, and then you need to wait for 3 turns of yours to use it again. Players are not allowed to use the special ability twice in a row, that is, if a player use special ability, then the next player cannot use it again.<br />
        ❀Single-player Mode:<br />
        ➥Tap or swipe on the logo on the title screen until it gets whole white or whole black to enter this mode. Then you can play with our computers and enjoy those challenges.<br />
        ❀Zephyrus:<br />
        ➥When your score is less than computer's by 3, the computer will use its special ability to move all discs together to the left by one unit.
